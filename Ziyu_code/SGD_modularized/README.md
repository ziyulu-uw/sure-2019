# Modularized SGD
------------
To test the gradient computation with finite difference methods, run grad_test_main.py.

To run SGD, run SGD_main.py.

To change the initialization of K, number of iterations, learning rate, or random seeds, edit the code in SGD_main.py.

To change the constant coefficients (observation noise variance, initial state, etc), edit the code in Initialization.py.
