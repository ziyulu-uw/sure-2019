# Modularized SGD
------------
To test the gradient computation with finite difference methods or run SGD, (uncomment and) run the code in main.py.

To change the initialization of K, number of iterations, learning rate, or random seeds, edit the code in main.py.

To change the constant coefficients (observation noise variance, initial state, etc), edit the code in Initialization.py.
